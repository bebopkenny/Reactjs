# React.js Practice Projects

This repository contains the practice projects I am completing while following the [Learn React JS - Full Beginner’s Tutorial (2024) & Practice Projects](https://youtu.be/b9eMGE7QtTk) by freeCodeCamp.org. I created this repo to re-learn React.js and strengthen my understanding of its fundamentals and best practices.

## Background

I struggled with React.js during a recent hackathon at California State University, Long Beach (BeachHacks). My team decided to use React.js, but I found myself forgetting the syntax and key concepts. I am revisiting this tutorial so I can become more confident for upcoming hackathons like FullyHacks at California State University, Fullerton and DavisHacks at University of California, Davis.

## Tutorial Overview

The tutorial is an interactive course covering modern React from the basics to more advanced concepts. It includes over 170 coding challenges and six projects. The course topics include:

1. React basics and introduction to React with Vite
2. Building composable components and using JSX
3. Props, state, and event handling
4. Advanced features such as hooks (useState, useEffect)
5. Multiple project builds like Tenzies, Meme Generator, and Chef Claude
6. Helpful tooling and extensions for React development

These projects are designed to give hands-on experience. By the end of the tutorial, the learner gains practical skills needed to tackle real-world applications.

## Projects in This Repository

1. **Section 1 – React Basics**
   This section explores JSX, the concept of declarative coding in React, creating and organizing components, and basic styling.

2. **Section 2 – Travel Journal**
   This project focuses on passing data through props, mapping over arrays to render repeated UI elements, and using a consistent component structure.

3. **Section 3 – Chef Claude**
   This section emphasizes form handling, managing array and object state, conditional rendering, and event-driven user interactions.

4. **Section 4 – Meme Generator**
   This section covers data fetching using useEffect, controlling inputs, and practicing state manipulation in a more dynamic project.

5. **Section 5 – Tenzies**
   This is a game-building project that demonstrates state management, randomization, re-renders, and the concept of “finishing” a game state.

6. **Section 6 – Assembly Endgame**
   A final consolidation of everything learned, building a more complex app that includes custom logic, advanced state management, and structured data flows.

## Goals

1. Refresh my knowledge of core React features and patterns.
2. Improve my confidence in building projects from scratch in React.
3. Prepare for future hackathons by practicing real-world coding strategies.
4. Develop a solid foundation that allows me to build interactive interfaces efficiently.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bebopkenny/Reactjs.git
```
2. 2. Navigate into the project directory of your choice:
```bash
cd section-1-react-basics
```
3. Install dependencies (each project may have its own package.json):
```bash
npm install
```
4. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
5. Open your browser at the address shown in your console, usually `http://localhost:5173` or similar.
